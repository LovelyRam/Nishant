							<p class="pad_bot3">The mutual fund industry of India is continuously evolving. Along the way, several industry bodies are also investing towards investor education. Yet, according to a report by Boston Analytics, less than 10% of our households consider mutual funds as an investment avenue. It is still considered as a high-risk option.
In fact, a basic inquiry about the types of mutual funds reveals that these are perhaps one of the most flexible, comprehensive and hassle free modes of investments that can accommodate various types of investor needs.
Various types of mutual funds categories are designed to allow investors to choose a scheme based on the risk they are willing to take, the investable amount, their goals, the investment term, etc.</p>
							<p><strong>Let us have a look at some important mutual fund schemes under the following three categories based on maturity period of investment:</strong><br/>
							<strong>I. Open-Ended - </strong>This scheme allows investors to buy or sell units at any point in time. This does not have a fixed maturity date.</p>
						</div>
						<p><strong>1. Debt/ Income - </strong>In a debt/income scheme, a major part of the investable fund are channelized towards debentures, government securities, and other debt instruments. Although capital appreciation is low (compared to the equity mutual funds), this is a relatively low risk-low return investment avenue which is ideal for investors seeing a steady income.</p>
						
						<p class="marg_top"><strong>2. Money Market/ Liquid - </strong>This is ideal for investors looking to utilize their surplus funds in short term instruments while awaiting better options. These schemes invest in short-term debt instruments and seek to provide reasonable returns for the investors.
</p>

<p class="marg_top"><strong>3. Equity/ Growth - </strong>Equities are a popular mutual fund category amongst retail investors. Although it could be a high-risk investment in the short term, investors can expect capital appreciation in the long run. If you are at your prime earning stage and looking for long-term benefits, growth schemes could be an ideal investment.

</p>

<p class="marg_top"><strong>3.i. Index Scheme -</strong> Index schemes is a widely popular concept in the west. These follow a passive investment strategy where your investments replicate the movements of benchmark indices like Nifty, Sensex, etc.
</p>

<p class="marg_top"><strong>3.ii. Sectoral Scheme - </strong>Sectoral funds are invested in a specific sector like infrastructure, IT, pharmaceuticals, etc. or segments of the capital market like large caps, mid caps, etc. This scheme provides a relatively high risk-high return opportunity within the equity space.
</p>

<p class="marg_top"><strong>3.iii. Tax Saving - </strong>As the name suggests, this scheme offers tax benefits to its investors. The funds are invested in equities thereby offering long-term growth opportunities. Tax saving mutual funds (called Equity Linked Savings Schemes) has a 3-year lock-in period.
</p>

<p class="marg_top"><strong>4. Balanced - </strong>This scheme allows investors to enjoy growth and income at regular intervals. Funds are invested in both equities and fixed income securities; the proportion is pre-determined and disclosed in the scheme related offer document. These are ideal for the cautiously aggressive investors.
</p>

<p class="marg_top"><strong>II. Closed-Ended - </strong>In India, this type of scheme has a stipulated maturity period and investors can invest only during the initial launch period known as the NFO (New Fund Offer) period.
</p>
<p class="marg_top"><strong>1. Capital Protection - </strong>The primary objective of this scheme is to safeguard the principal amount while trying to deliver reasonable returns. These invest in high-quality fixed income securities with marginal exposure to equities and mature along with the maturity period of the scheme.

</p>
<p class="marg_top"><strong>2. Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) - </strong>FMPs, as the name suggests, are mutual fund schemes with a defined maturity period. These schemes normally comprise of debt instruments which mature in line with the maturity of the scheme, thereby earning through the interest component (also called coupons) of the securities in the portfolio. FMPs are normally passively managed, i.e. there is no active trading of debt instruments in the portfolio. The expenses which are charged to the scheme, are hence, generally lower than actively managed schemes.
</p>
<p class="marg_top"><strong>III. Interval - </strong>Operating as a combination of open and closed ended schemes, it allows investors to trade units at pre-defined intervals.
